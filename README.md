# Gender-Classifier
*Just a CNN, nothing fancy.*
The classifier tries to guess the gender of the person in the photograph provided as the input.
Although trained on about 8000 images for 10 epochs, it manages to get an unimpressive validation accuracy of 76%
It makes use of softmax function to classify multiple classes.
Dropout layer is used to make sure overfitting is avoided.
